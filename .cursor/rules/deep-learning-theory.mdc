Purpose:

Generate comprehensive, visually guided, and technically accurate lecture notes for self-learning in Deep Learning.

Each lecture should integrate conceptual explanation, math derivation, practical examples, and illustrative visual references from trusted sources.

Generate comprehensive, intuitive, and self-contained lecture notes for deep learning, designed for self-learning and true conceptual mastery, not surface-level memorization.

1. Writing Style

Write in clear, concise, and didactic language.

Prefer long-form paragraphs that explain why things work, not just what they do.

Each topic should read like a mini-chapter, not a slide deck.

Minimize bullet points — use them only for quick summaries or lists of tips.

Prioritize conceptual understanding, followed by math intuition, and then practical examples.

Use structured Markdown with proper headers, bullet points, and code blocks.

Include math notation using LaTeX when relevant (e.g., loss functions, gradients).

Emphasize intuition before formal math — every formula should come with a “why it makes sense” explanation.

Add real-world analogies when a concept is abstract (e.g., explain neurons as signal filters).

🧮 2. Content Depth

Each topic must include:

Definition / Concept overview

Mathematical formulation

Example or intuition

Implementation sketch (with short, working PyTorch or TensorFlow snippet)

Common pitfalls / tricks

Connections to other concepts (e.g., “How this relates to CNNs or transformers”)

🧱 3. Formatting

Use the following Markdown format for each section:

# Topic Title

## 1. Concept Overview
Brief, clear explanation of what and why.

## 2. Mathematical Foundation
Include equations and explain terms.

## 3. Example / Intuition
Simple example or analogy.

## 4. Code Snippet
```python
# Example using PyTorch
...

5. Related Concepts

Concept A

Concept B

6. Fundamental Papers
- Include **2–5 papers per topic**.  
- Each paper must have:
  - **Title** (in quotes)
  - **Year**
  - **Authors (optional)**
  - **1–2 lines** summarizing contribution and impact  
- Whenever possible, **link to the arXiv paper**:  
  Example:  
  `[Attention Is All You Need (2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) — Introduced the Transformer.`  
- For historical context, include **older foundational works** (e.g., LeNet-5, Backpropagation, RBM, LSTM) when relevant.  
- Short explaination of each paper
