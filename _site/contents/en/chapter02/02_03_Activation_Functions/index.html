  </h1>
  <p>This lesson provides an in-depth exploration of activation functions, their properties, and how to choose the right one for your neural network.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-activation-functions-matter">Why Activation Functions Matter</h2>

<p><strong>Without activation functions</strong>, neural networks would be limited to learning only linear transformations. No matter how many layers you stack, a composition of linear functions is still linear:</p>

\[f(g(h(\mathbf{x}))) = \mathbf{A}_1(\mathbf{A}_2(\mathbf{A}_3 \mathbf{x})) = (\mathbf{A}_1 \mathbf{A}_2 \mathbf{A}_3)\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}\]

<p><strong>Activation functions introduce nonlinearity</strong>, enabling networks to learn complex patterns and approximate arbitrary functions.</p>

<h2 id="desirable-properties-of-activation-functions">Desirable Properties of Activation Functions</h2>

<p>An ideal activation function should have:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Nonlinearity</strong>: Enable learning of complex patterns</li>
  <li><strong>Differentiability</strong>: Enable gradient-based deep-learning</li>
  <li><strong>Monotonicity</strong>: Preserve ordering (helpful for deep-learning)</li>
  <li><strong>Computational efficiency</strong>: Fast to compute forward and backward</li>
  <li><strong>Bounded or unbounded appropriately</strong>: Depending on the task</li>
  <li><strong>Zero-centered</strong>: Help with gradient flow (for hidden layers)</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid saturation</strong>: Prevent vanishing gradients</li>
</ol>

<p>No single activation function satisfies all properties perfectly, so the choice depends on the specific use case.</p>

<h2 id="common-activation-functions">Common Activation Functions</h2>

<h3 id="1-sigmoid-logistic-function">1. Sigmoid (Logistic Function)</h3>

\[\sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}\]

<p><strong>Derivative:</strong></p>

\[\sigma'(z) = \sigma(z)(1 - \sigma(z))\]

<p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Range: \((0, 1)\)</li>
  <li>Smooth, differentiable everywhere</li>
  <li>Monotonically increasing</li>
  <li>Saturates at both ends</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Clear probabilistic interpretation</li>
  <li>Smooth gradient</li>
  <li>Historically popular</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <table>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td><strong>Vanishing gradient problem</strong>: Gradients near 0 for $$</td>
          <td>z</td>
          <td>&gt; 4$$</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Not zero-centered</strong>: Outputs always positive</li>
  <li><strong>Computationally expensive</strong>: Requires exponential calculation</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Output layer for binary classification</li>
  <li>Gate activations in LSTMs</li>
  <li>Generally avoided in hidden layers of deep networks</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-hyperbolic-tangent-tanh">2. Hyperbolic Tangent (tanh)</h3>

\[\tanh(z) = \frac{e^z - e^{-z}}{e^z + e^{-z}} = \frac{e^{2z} - 1}{e^{2z} + 1} = 2\sigma(2z) - 1\]

<p><strong>Derivative:</strong></p>

\[\tanh'(z) = 1 - \tanh^2(z)\]

<p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Range: \((-1, 1)\)</li>
  <li>Zero-centered (improvement over sigmoid)</li>
  <li>Saturates at both ends</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Zero-centered (better gradient flow)</li>
  <li>Stronger gradients than sigmoid (derivative range: \((0, 1]\))</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Still suffers from vanishing gradients</li>
  <li>Computationally expensive</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Hidden layers (better than sigmoid but worse than ReLU)</li>
  <li>RNN/LSTM cells</li>
  <li>When zero-centered outputs are beneficial</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-rectified-linear-unit-relu">3. Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)</h3>

\[\text{ReLU}(z) = \max(0, z) = \begin{cases} z &amp; \text{if } z &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \text{if } z \leq 0 \end{cases}\]

<p><strong>Derivative:</strong></p>

\[\text{ReLU}'(z) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if } z &gt; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \text{if } z \leq 0 \\ \text{undefined} &amp; \text{if } z = 0 \end{cases}\]

<p>(In practice, we define \(\text{ReLU}'(0) = 0\) or \(0.5\))</p>

<p><strong>Properties:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Range: \([0, \infty)\)</li>
  <li>Not saturating for positive values</li>
  <li>Sparse activation (many neurons output 0)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Computational efficiency</strong>: Just thresholding at zero</li>
  <li><strong>Alleviates vanishing gradient</strong>: Gradient is 1 for positive inputs</li>
  <li><strong>Sparse representations</strong>: Natural sparsity</li>
  <li><strong>Empirically successful</strong>: Works very well in practice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Not zero-centered</strong>: All outputs are non-negative</li>
  <li><strong>Dying ReLU problem</strong>: Neurons can become inactive forever
    <ul>
      <li>If \(z &lt; 0\) always, gradient is always 0, no learning occurs</li>
      <li>Can happen with high learning rates or poor initialization</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Use cases:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Default choice</strong> for hidden layers in deep networks</li>
  <li>CNNs, ResNets, most modern architectures</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-leaky-relu">4. Leaky ReLU</h3>

\[\text{LeakyReLU}(z) = \begin{cases} z &amp; \text{if } z &gt; 0 \\ \alpha z &amp; \text{if } z \leq 0 \end{cases}\]

<p>where \(\alpha\) is a small constant (typically 0.01)</p>

<p><strong>Derivative:</strong></p>

\[\text{LeakyReLU}'(z) = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{if } z &gt; 0 \\ \alpha &amp; \text{if } z \leq 0 \end{cases}\]

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Prevents dying ReLU</strong>: Small gradient even for negative inputs</li>
  <li>Computationally efficient</li>
  <li>All benefits of ReLU</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Introduces hyperparameter \(\alpha\)</li>
  <li>Not always better than ReLU in practice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Variants:</strong></p>
<ul>

<h3 id="for-hidden-layers">For Hidden Layers</h3>

<p><strong>Default recommendation: ReLU</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Start with ReLU for most applications</li>
  <li>Computationally efficient</li>
  <li>Works well in practice</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If dying ReLU is a problem:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Try Leaky ReLU or ELU</li>
  <li>Check learning rate and initialization</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For modern/large-scale models:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>GELU for transformers and NLP</li>
  <li>Swish for image models when performance is critical</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>For very deep networks:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Consider ELU or SELU</li>
  <li>May need normalization techniques (covered later)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="for-output-layers">For Output Layers</h3>

<h2 id="the-vanishing-gradient-problem">The Vanishing Gradient Problem</h2>

<h3 id="why-it-matters">Why It Matters</h3>

<p>During backpropagation, gradients are multiplied through layers:</p>

\[\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{W}^{[1]}} = \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \mathbf{a}^{[L]}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{a}^{[L]}}{\partial \mathbf{z}^{[L]}} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{z}^{[2]}}{\partial \mathbf{a}^{[1]}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{a}^{[1]}}{\partial \mathbf{z}^{[1]}} \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{z}^{[1]}}{\partial \mathbf{W}^{[1]}}\]

<h3 id="problem-with-sigmoidtanh">Problem with Sigmoid/Tanh</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Maximum derivative: \(\sigma'(z) = 0.25\) (sigmoid), \(\tanh'(z) = 1\) (tanh at \(z=0\))</li>
  <li>Typical derivative: Much smaller (\(&lt; 0.25\) for sigmoid)</li>
  <li>After many layers: \(0.25^{10} \approx 9.5 \times 10^{-7}\) (extremely small!)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Result</strong>: Gradients vanish, early layers learn very slowly or not at all.</p>

<h3 id="relu-to-the-rescue">ReLU to the Rescue</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Derivative is 1 for positive inputs (no vanishing)</li>
  <li>Gradient flows unchanged through active ReLU units</li>
  <li>Enables training of much deeper networks</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-dying-relu-problem">The Dying ReLU Problem</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If \(z &lt; 0\) always, gradient is 0, no learning</li>
  <li>Can happen with:
    <ul>
      <li>Poor initialization</li>
      <li>High learning rates</li>
      <li>Unlucky updates</li>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Activation functions</strong> introduce nonlinearity, enabling networks to learn complex patterns</li>
  <li><strong>ReLU</strong> is the default choice for hidden layers in modern deep learning</li>
  <li><strong>Sigmoid</strong> is used for binary classification outputs</li>
  <li><strong>Softmax</strong> is used for multi-class classification outputs</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced activations</strong> (ELU, Swish, GELU) can provide performance improvements</li>
  <li><strong>Vanishing gradients</strong> are a major issue with sigmoid/tanh in deep networks</li>
  <li><strong>ReLU</strong> alleviates vanishing gradients but introduces the dying ReLU problem</li>
  <li>Choice of activation function significantly impacts training and performance</li>
</ul>

<p>In the next lesson, we’ll explore forward propagation in detail with concrete examples.</p>
