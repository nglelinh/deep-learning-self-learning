    02-04 Forward Propagation

  </h1>
  <p>This lesson provides a comprehensive understanding of forward propagation, the process by which neural networks make predictions.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-is-forward-propagation">What is Forward Propagation?</h2>

<p><strong>Forward propagation</strong> is the process of computing the output of a neural network given an input. Data “flows forward” through the network from the input layer to the output layer, passing through all hidden layers in sequence.</p>

<p>This is the <strong>inference</strong> or <strong>prediction</strong> phase of a neural network.</p>

<h2 id="the-forward-pass-step-by-step">The Forward Pass: Step by Step</h2>

<p>Consider a simple 3-layer network:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Input layer</strong>: \(n^{[0]} = 3\) features</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden layer 1</strong>: \(n^{[1]} = 4\) neurons with ReLU</li>
  <li><strong>Hidden layer 2</strong>: \(n^{[2]} = 4\) neurons with ReLU</li>
  <li><strong>Output layer</strong>: \(n^{[3]} = 1\) neuron with sigmoid (binary classification)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="layer-0-input">Layer 0: Input</h3>

\[\mathbf{a}^{[0]} = \mathbf{x} = \begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \end{bmatrix}\]

<h3 id="layer-1-first-hidden-layer">Layer 1: First Hidden Layer</h3>

<p><strong>Linear transformation:</strong></p>

\[\mathbf{z}^{[1]} = \mathbf{W}^{[1]} \mathbf{a}^{[0]} + \mathbf{b}^{[1]}\]

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\mathbf{W}^{[1]} \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 3}\) (4 neurons, 3 inputs each)</li>
  <li>\(\mathbf{b}^{[1]} \in \mathbb{R}^{4}\) (4 biases)</li>
  <li>\(\mathbf{z}^{[1]} \in \mathbb{R}^{4}\) (pre-activation values)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Activation:</strong></p>

\[\mathbf{a}^{[1]} = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{z}^{[1]}) = \max(0, \mathbf{z}^{[1]})\]

<p>\(\mathbf{a}^{[1]} \in \mathbb{R}^{4}\) (activations/outputs of layer 1)</p>

<h3 id="layer-2-second-hidden-layer">Layer 2: Second Hidden Layer</h3>

<p><strong>Linear transformation:</strong></p>

\[\mathbf{z}^{[2]} = \mathbf{W}^{[2]} \mathbf{a}^{[1]} + \mathbf{b}^{[2]}\]

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
\[\mathbf{W}^{[2]} \in \mathbb{R}^{4 \times 4}\]
  </li>
  <li>
\[\mathbf{b}^{[2]} \in \mathbb{R}^{4}\]
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Activation:</strong></p>

\[\mathbf{a}^{[2]} = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{z}^{[2]})\]

<h3 id="layer-3-output-layer">Layer 3: Output Layer</h3>

<p><strong>Linear transformation:</strong></p>

\[\mathbf{z}^{[3]} = \mathbf{W}^{[3]} \mathbf{a}^{[2]} + \mathbf{b}^{[3]}\]

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
\[\mathbf{W}^{[3]} \in \mathbb{R}^{1 \times 4}\]
  </li>
  <li>
\[\mathbf{b}^{[3]} \in \mathbb{R}^{1}\]
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Activation (output):</strong></p>

\[\hat{y} = \mathbf{a}^{[3]} = \sigma(\mathbf{z}^{[3]}) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\mathbf{z}^{[3]}}}\]

<p>This gives us the predicted probability of the positive class.</p>

<h2 id="vectorized-forward-propagation">Vectorized Forward Propagation</h2>

<p>For computational efficiency, we process <strong>multiple examples simultaneously</strong> using <strong>vectorization</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="batch-processing">Batch Processing</h3>

<p>Instead of processing one example at a time, we organize \(m\) examples into a matrix:</p>

\[\mathbf{X} = \begin{bmatrix} | &amp; | &amp; &amp; | \\ \mathbf{x}^{(1)} &amp; \mathbf{x}^{(2)} &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf{x}^{(m)} \\ | &amp; | &amp; &amp; | \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^{[0]} \times m}\]

<p>Each column is one training example.</p>

<h3 id="vectorized-computation">Vectorized Computation</h3>

<p>For layer \(l\):</p>

\[\mathbf{Z}^{[l]} = \mathbf{W}^{[l]} \mathbf{A}^{[l-1]} + \mathbf{b}^{[l]}\]

\[\mathbf{A}^{[l]} = g^{[l]}(\mathbf{Z}^{[l]})\]

<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\mathbf{A}^{[l]} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^{[l]} \times m}\) (each column is activations for one example)</li>
  <li>
\[\mathbf{Z}^{[l]} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^{[l]} \times m}\]
  </li>
  <li>
\[\mathbf{W}^{[l]} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^{[l]} \times n^{[l-1]}}\]
  </li>
  <li>\(\mathbf{b}^{[l]} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^{[l]} \times 1}\) (broadcasted across all \(m\) examples)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="broadcasting">Broadcasting</h3>

<p>Python/NumPy automatically broadcasts \(\mathbf{b}^{[l]}\) across all examples:</p>

\[\mathbf{b}^{[l]} \in \mathbb{R}^{n^{[l]} \times 1} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n^{[l]} \times m}\]

<p>Each column of the result gets the same bias vector added.</p>

<h2 id="concrete-example-with-numbers">Concrete Example with Numbers</h2>

<p>Let’s work through a small example with actual numbers.</p>

<h3 id="network-setup">Network Setup</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Input: 2 features (\(n^{[0]} = 2\))</li>
  <li>Hidden layer: 3 neurons with ReLU (\(n^{[1]} = 3\))</li>
  <li>Output: 1 neuron with sigmoid (\(n^{[2]} = 1\))</li>
  <li>Batch size: 2 examples (\(m = 2\))</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="parameters">Parameters</h3>

\[\mathbf{W}^{[1]} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 &amp; -0.3 \\ 0.2 &amp; 0.8 \\ -0.4 &amp; 0.6 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b}^{[1]} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.1 \\ -0.2 \\ 0.3 \end{bmatrix}\]

\[\mathbf{W}^{[2]} = \begin{bmatrix} 1.0 &amp; -0.5 &amp; 0.7 \end{bmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b}^{[2]} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \end{bmatrix}\]

<h3 id="input-data">Input Data</h3>

\[\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{A}^{[0]} = \begin{bmatrix} 1.0 &amp; 0.5 \\ 2.0 &amp; 1.5 \end{bmatrix}\]

<p>Example 1: \(\mathbf{x}^{(1)} = \begin{bmatrix} 1.0 \\ 2.0 \end{bmatrix}\), Example 2: \(\mathbf{x}^{(2)} = \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 \\ 1.5 \end{bmatrix}\)</p>

<h3 id="forward-pass-layer-1">Forward Pass: Layer 1</h3>

<p><strong>Compute \(\mathbf{Z}^{[1]}\):</strong></p>

\[\mathbf{Z}^{[1]} = \mathbf{W}^{[1]} \mathbf{A}^{[0]} + \mathbf{b}^{[1]}\]

\[= \begin{bmatrix} 0.5 &amp; -0.3 \\ 0.2 &amp; 0.8 \\ -0.4 &amp; 0.6 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1.0 &amp; 0.5 \\ 2.0 &amp; 1.5 \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} 0.1 \\ -0.2 \\ 0.3 \end{bmatrix}\]

<h2 id="forward-propagation-complexity">Forward Propagation Complexity</h2>

<h3 id="time-complexity">Time Complexity</h3>

<p>For a network with \(L\) layers and \(n\) neurons per layer:</p>

\[O(L \cdot n^2 \cdot m)\]

<p>where \(m\) is the batch size.</p>

<p><strong>Breakdown:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Each layer: \(O(n^2 \cdot m)\) for matrix multiplication \(\mathbf{W}^{[l]} \mathbf{A}^{[l-1]}\)</li>
  <li>\(L\) layers total</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="space-complexity">Space Complexity</h3>

\[O(L \cdot n \cdot m)\]

<p>Need to store activations for each layer (needed for backpropagation).</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Forward propagation</strong> computes predictions by passing inputs through the network</li>
  <li>Each layer performs: <strong>linear transformation</strong> → <strong>activation function</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Vectorization</strong> allows efficient batch processing of multiple examples</li>
  <li>The process is: \(\mathbf{Z}^{[l]} = \mathbf{W}^{[l]} \mathbf{A}^{[l-1]} + \mathbf{b}^{[l]}, \quad \mathbf{A}^{[l]} = g^{[l]}(\mathbf{Z}^{[l]})\)</li>
  <li><strong>Caching</strong> intermediate values is essential for efficient backpropagation</li>
  <li>Proper handling of <strong>dimensions</strong> and <strong>numerical stability</strong> is crucial</li>
  <li>Forward propagation is <strong>computationally efficient</strong> (\(O(L \cdot n^2 \cdot m)\))</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we understand how networks make predictions, we need to learn how to train them. In the next chapter, we’ll cover <strong>backpropagation</strong> and <strong>gradient descent</strong>, the algorithms that enable neural networks to learn from data.</p>
