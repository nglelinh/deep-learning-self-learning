<h2 id="1-concept-overview">1. Concept Overview</h2>

<p>Generative Adversarial Networks represent one of the most creative and impactful ideas in recent machine learning history. Introduced by Ian Goodfellow and colleagues in 2014, GANs approach generative modeling through an entirely novel paradigm: training two neural networks in competition with each other. A generator network learns to create fake data that looks real, while a discriminator network learns to distinguish real data from the generator’s fakes. As these networks improve through their adversarial game, the generator becomes increasingly skilled at creating realistic outputs, eventually producing samples indistinguishable from real data.</p>

<p>The elegance and power of this idea is best appreciated by understanding what preceded it. Traditional generative models like Gaussian Mixture Models or Hidden Markov Models required explicit probabilistic formulations and often made restrictive assumptions about data distribution. Variational autoencoders used neural networks but required explicit density models and variational inference. GANs sidestep these complexities entirely. We never explicitly model the probability density \(p(x)\). Instead, we implicitly learn to sample from it through the generator network. This implicit density modeling enables generating high-dimensional, complex data (like realistic images) that would be intractable to model explicitly.</p>

<p>The adversarial training framework is inspired by game theory, specifically zero-sum games where one player’s gain is another’s loss. The generator tries to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator tries not to be fooled. This creates a natural curriculum: as the discriminator improves at detecting fakes, it provides increasingly challenging training signal to the generator, pushing it to create better fakes. Conversely, as the generator improves, the discriminator must become more discerning. At equilibrium—when the discriminator cannot distinguish real from fake better than random guessing—the generator has learned to perfectly model the data distribution.</p>

<p>Understanding GANs deeply requires grappling with several conceptual challenges. Training two networks simultaneously in opposition is fundamentally different from standard supervised learning where we optimize a single network. The loss for one network depends on the other network’s parameters, creating a moving target that can lead to instability. Mode collapse—where the generator learns to produce only a few types of outputs rather than capturing the full data diversity—is a persistent challenge. Measuring GAN performance is non-trivial since we can’t simply evaluate likelihood (we don’t have an explicit density model). These challenges make GANs notoriously difficult to train, requiring careful architecture design, loss function choices, and training tricks accumulated through years of research.</p>

<p>Yet the results speak for themselves. GANs can generate photorealistic faces that don’t exist, transform horses into zebras, create art in specific styles, upscale low-resolution images, and countless other applications. The quality of GAN-generated images often exceeds VAEs and other generative approaches. This practical success, despite training difficulties, has made GANs one of the most active research areas in deep learning, with hundreds of variants proposed to stabilize training, improve quality, or enable new applications. Understanding the original GAN framework provides foundation for appreciating this vast landscape of extensions and applications.</p>

<h2 id="2-mathematical-foundation">2. Mathematical Foundation</h2>

<p>The mathematical framework of GANs is based on a minimax game between generator and discriminator. Let’s build this up carefully, understanding each component’s role and how they interact.</p>

<p>The generator \(G\) is a neural network that maps random noise \(\mathbf{z}\) sampled from a simple distribution (typically \(\mathbf{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\)) to fake data:</p>

\[\mathbf{x}_{\text{fake}} = G(\mathbf{z}; \theta_G)\]

<p>where \(\theta_G\) represents generator parameters. The noise vector \(\mathbf{z}\) serves as the source of variation—different noise vectors should produce different fake samples, and the generator learns to map the noise distribution to the data distribution.</p>

<p>The discriminator \(D\) is a neural network that takes an input \(\mathbf{x}\) (either real data or generator output) and outputs a probability that it’s real:</p>

\[D(\mathbf{x}; \theta_D) \in [0, 1]\]

<p>where \(\theta_D\) represents discriminator parameters. Typically \(D\) ends with a sigmoid activation: \(D(\mathbf{x}) = \sigma(f_{\theta_D}(\mathbf{x}))\) where \(f\) is the discriminator’s feature extractor (convolutional layers, etc.).</p>

<p>The training objective is formulated as a minimax game:</p>

\[\min_G \max_D V(D, G) = \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim p_{\text{data}}}[\log D(\mathbf{x})] + \mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z} \sim p_z}[\log(1 - D(G(\mathbf{z})))]\]

<p>Let’s parse this carefully. The discriminator wants to maximize \(V\):</p>
<ul>
  <li>\(\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim p_{\text{data}}}[\log D(\mathbf{x})]\): Assign high probability to real data (\(D(\mathbf{x}) \to 1\), so \(\log D(\mathbf{x}) \to 0\))</li>
  <li>\(\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z} \sim p_z}[\log(1 - D(G(\mathbf{z})))]\): Assign low probability to fakes (\(D(G(\mathbf{z})) \to 0\), so \(\log(1-D(G(\mathbf{z}))) \to 0\))</li>
</ul>

<p>The generator wants to minimize \(V\), specifically minimize \(\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{z}}[\log(1 - D(G(\mathbf{z})))]\), making the discriminator assign high probability to its fakes.</p>

<p>However, in practice, minimizing \(\log(1-D(G(\mathbf{z})))\) causes problems early in training when the generator is poor and \(D(G(\mathbf{z})) \approx 0\). The gradient of \(\log(1-D(G(\mathbf{z})))\) with respect to generator parameters is very small when \(D(G(\mathbf{z}))\) is small, providing weak learning signal exactly when the generator needs to improve most. The solution is a non-saturating variant: instead of minimizing \(\log(1-D(G(\mathbf{z})))\), maximize \(\log D(G(\mathbf{z}))\). These aren’t equivalent—the second provides much stronger gradients when \(D(G(\mathbf{z}))\) is small.</p>

<p>The training alternates between discriminator and generator updates:</p>

<p><strong>Discriminator update</strong> (maximize \(V\) with respect to \(\theta_D\)):</p>

\[\theta_D \leftarrow \theta_D + \eta_D \nabla_{\theta_D} \left[\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m \log D(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) + \log(1-D(G(\mathbf{z}^{(i)})))\right]\]

<p><strong>Generator update</strong> (minimize \(V\) with respect to \(\theta_G\), using non-saturating objective):</p>

\[\theta_G \leftarrow \theta_G - \eta_G \nabla_{\theta_G} \left[\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^m \log D(G(\mathbf{z}^{(i)}))\right]\]

<p>The gradients for the generator pass through the discriminator: \(\nabla_{\theta_G} D(G(\mathbf{z}))\) requires backpropagating through both \(G\) and \(D\). This coupling means generator training depends critically on discriminator providing meaningful gradients—if the discriminator is too perfect (always correctly identifying fakes), gradients vanish; if too poor (can’t distinguish real from fake), gradients are misleading.</p>

<p>This delicate balance motivates various training strategies. We might train the discriminator \(k\) times per generator update (typically \(k=1\) or \(5\)), ensuring it stays ahead of the generator. We might add instance noise to discriminator inputs early in training, making its task harder and preventing it from becoming too strong too quickly. We might use different learning rates for generator and discriminator (often \(\eta_G &lt; \eta_D\)) to control their relative improvement rates.</p>

<p>At the theoretical equilibrium where \(p_G = p_{\text{data}}\) (generator distribution equals data distribution), the optimal discriminator is \(D^*(\mathbf{x}) = \frac{p_{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x})}{p_{\text{data}}(\mathbf{x}) + p_G(\mathbf{x})} = 0.5\) everywhere—it cannot distinguish real from fake. At this point, both loss terms equal \(\log(0.5)\), and neither network can improve by changing. This equilibrium corresponds to the generator perfectly modeling the data distribution.</p>

<p>However, reaching this equilibrium in practice is challenging. The training dynamics can cycle, oscillate, or diverge. Mode collapse occurs when the generator discovers it can fool the discriminator by generating only a subset of the data distribution (modes)—if producing only digit “1” fools the discriminator, why bother learning to generate other digits? Various regularization techniques (minibatch discrimination, unrolled optimization, spectral normalization) address these instabilities, showing that successful GAN training requires understanding the adversarial dynamics deeply, not just implementing the basic algorithm.</p>

<h2 id="3-example--intuition">3. Example / Intuition</h2>

<p>To build intuition for the adversarial training process, imagine a scenario with counterfeit money (generator) and bank inspector (discriminator). Initially, the counterfeiter produces poor fakes—perhaps using a home printer that makes obviously fake bills. The inspector easily identifies these as fake (discriminator outputs near 0 for generator samples). This clear signal tells the counterfeiter what’s wrong—the texture is wrong, colors are off, security features are missing.</p>

<p>The counterfeiter improves, using better equipment and studying real bills more carefully. Now fakes are harder to detect—maybe they pass casual inspection but fail under UV light. The inspector learns to check UV features (discriminator learns more sophisticated detection). This pushes the counterfeiter to replicate UV features too.</p>

<p>This arms race continues. Each improvement by one side forces the other to improve. Eventually, the counterfeiter creates bills so convincing that even expert inspection cannot reliably distinguish them from real bills—the equilibrium where \(D(\mathbf{x}) = 0.5\). At this point, the counterfeiter has learned to generate perfect currency.</p>

<p>The GAN training dynamic follows this pattern. Let’s trace through early training on generating MNIST digits:</p>

<p><strong>Iteration 1-10</strong> (Generator is terrible):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generator produces noise that vaguely resembles digit shapes</li>
  <li>Discriminator easily detects fakes (outputs near 0)</li>
  <li>Strong gradients tell generator: “make sharper edges,” “center the digit,” “use correct aspect ratio”</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Iteration 100-500</strong> (Generator is improving):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generator produces digit-like shapes, but wrong proportions or artifacts</li>
  <li>Discriminator learns subtle features distinguishing real from fake</li>
  <li>Maybe real 3s have specific curve ratios that fakes miss</li>
  <li>Generator learns to match these statistics</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Iteration 1000+</strong> (Approaching equilibrium):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generator produces convincing digits</li>
  <li>Discriminator performance approaches 50% accuracy</li>
  <li>Each generated sample looks like it could be from MNIST</li>
  <li>Latent space has structure: different \(\mathbf{z}\) produces different digits</li>
</ul>

<p>A concrete example with numbers: suppose at some training iteration, we generate a fake digit and the discriminator outputs \(D(G(\mathbf{z})) = 0.3\). The discriminator is somewhat confident this is fake (30% probability of real). The generator’s loss is \(-\log(0.3) = 1.20\). Gradients indicate how to change generator parameters to increase \(D(G(\mathbf{z}))\) toward 1. The generator learns to adjust its outputs to fool this particular discriminator configuration.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the discriminator sees both this fake (which it correctly identified with 70% confidence) and real digits (which it should assign high probability). Suppose on a real digit, it outputs \(D(\mathbf{x}_{\text{real}}) = 0.95\)—correctly identifying real data with 95% confidence. Its loss combines both: \(-\log(0.95) - \log(1-0.3) = 0.05 + 0.36 = 0.41\). Gradients tell it how to better separate real from fake distributions.</p>

<p>The adversarial dynamic is that the generator’s improvement makes the discriminator’s task harder (fakes become more convincing), while the discriminator’s improvement makes the generator’s task harder (must create more realistic fakes to fool a better detector). This mutual improvement drives both toward high capability.</p>

<p>Mode collapse manifests distinctly. Suppose the generator discovers that producing “1”s consistently fools the discriminator (maybe because “1” is simple and the discriminator hasn’t learned to detect fake “1”s yet). The generator might converge to producing only “1”s or a few “1”-like outputs, ignoring the rest of the digit manifold. The discriminator eventually learns to detect these specific fake “1”s, but by then the generator might have mode-collapsed to a different digit. The training never achieves the equilibrium where all modes are covered. Various techniques address this: minibatch discrimination lets the discriminator detect lack of diversity, unrolled optimization allows the generator to anticipate discriminator’s response, and architectural choices can encourage diversity.</p>

      <td>The relationship between GANs and variational autoencoders illuminates different approaches to generative modeling. VAEs explicitly model the data distribution through a latent variable model $$p(\mathbf{x}) = \int p(\mathbf{x}</td>
      <td>\mathbf{z})p(\mathbf{z})d\mathbf{z}$$, training through maximizing a variational lower bound on likelihood. This probabilistic framework provides theoretical guarantees and enables principled Bayesian inference but requires choosing parametric forms for distributions and often produces blurrier samples due to the reconstruction loss. GANs implicitly model distributions through the generator’s learned mapping from noise to data, using adversarial training instead of likelihood. This enables generating sharper, more realistic samples (because the discriminator can learn perceptual similarity rather than pixel-wise reconstruction) but lacks VAE’s theoretical guarantees and density estimation capability. Understanding both approaches reveals different tradeoffs: VAEs for theoretical understanding and density modeling, GANs for sample quality and flexibility.</td>

<p>GANs connect to game theory through the minimax formulation. The generator and discriminator play a two-player zero-sum game where one’s gain (discriminator correctly identifying fakes) is the other’s loss (generator’s fakes being detected). Nash equilibrium—where neither player can improve by unilaterally changing strategy—corresponds to the generator matching the data distribution. However, reaching Nash equilibrium in practice is challenging because we’re using gradient-based optimization, which makes local moves, in a non-convex game where equilibria might not exist or be unstable. This connection to game theory helps understand why GAN training can be unstable (many games have no pure strategy Nash equilibrium or have multiple equilibria) and motivates algorithms from game theory like unrolled optimization.</p>

<p>The relationship to adversarial examples and robustness provides an interesting perspective. In adversarial examples research, we perturb inputs slightly to fool classifiers. In GANs, we’re doing something similar but more ambitious: creating completely synthetic inputs that fool the discriminator. The discriminator trying to resist fooling is analogous to adversarial training for robust classifiers. This connection suggests techniques from adversarial robustness (like certified defenses) might apply to stabilizing GAN training, and conversely, that GAN discriminators might provide insights into what makes classifiers vulnerable to adversarial examples. The mathematical connection is deep: both involve optimizing over input space to maximize or minimize classifier outputs.</p>

<p>GANs’ impact on semi-supervised learning demonstrates how generative models can improve discriminative tasks. By adding an auxiliary task to the discriminator—not just real/fake but also classifying real images into categories—we can leverage unlabeled data (used for adversarial training) to improve classification on limited labeled data. The discriminator learns representations through both tasks, with the generative task providing regularization and additional training signal. This semi-supervised GAN framework has been successful in low-data regimes, showing how generative and discriminative learning can be mutually beneficial.</p>

<p>Finally, GANs connect to the broader theme of learning without direct supervision on the target task. We never show the generator example outputs—it learns purely from discriminator feedback. This is analogous to reinforcement learning where agents learn from reward signals rather than supervised examples. Indeed, GANs can be viewed as applying policy gradient methods (from RL) to generative modeling, with the discriminator providing rewards (high scores for good fakes) that guide generator improvement. This connection has led to hybrid approaches combining GAN training with reinforcement learning principles for improved stability and performance.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661">“Generative Adversarial Networks” (2014)</a></strong><br />
<em>Authors</em>: Ian Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio<br />
This foundational paper introduced the GAN framework and remains one of the most influential papers in modern machine learning. Goodfellow conceived the basic idea—training generator and discriminator adversarially—reportedly in a single evening, though the paper’s development involved significant theoretical and empirical work. The paper formalized GANs as a minimax game, proved that at equilibrium the generator learns the data distribution, and demonstrated results on several datasets. What made GANs revolutionary was not just the results but the paradigm shift: generative modeling through competition rather than likelihood maximization or reconstruction. The paper acknowledged training challenges (instability, mode collapse) while showing the approach’s potential. Reading it today, one appreciates both the clarity of the core idea and the prescience about challenges that would occupy researchers for years. GANs demonstrated that sometimes the best way to solve a problem isn’t to attack it directly (modeling density explicitly) but indirectly (learning to generate through adversarial feedback).</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434">“Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks” (2016)</a></strong><br />
<em>Authors</em>: Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala<br />
The DCGAN paper made GANs practical by identifying architectural guidelines that stabilize training and improve sample quality. The authors systematically explored design choices—convolutional vs fully connected layers, batch normalization placement, activation functions—finding combinations that consistently worked. Their guidelines: use strided convolutions instead of pooling, use batch norm in both networks (except generator output and discriminator input), use ReLU in generator except output (tanh), use LeakyReLU in discriminator. These weren’t theoretically motivated but empirically discovered through extensive experimentation, demonstrating that practical progress sometimes comes from systematic engineering rather than mathematical insight. DCGAN showed that GANs could generate high-quality images (64×64 faces) and that the learned latent space had meaningful structure—arithmetic in latent space (vector for “smiling woman” minus “neutral woman” plus “neutral man”) produced “smiling man.” This demonstrated GANs learn disentangled representations encoding semantic attributes, making them useful beyond generation for representation learning.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498">“Improved Techniques for Training GANs” (2016)</a></strong><br />
<em>Authors</em>: Tim Salimans, Ian Goodfellow, Wojciech Zaremba, Vicki Cheung, Alec Radford, Xi Chen<br />
This paper addressed GAN training instabilities through several techniques: feature matching (train generator to match statistics of discriminator’s intermediate features rather than fool final output), minibatch discrimination (let discriminator compare examples within a batch to detect lack of diversity), historical averaging (penalize parameters for deviating from historical averages), one-sided label smoothing (use 0.9 instead of 1.0 for real labels to prevent discriminator overconfidence), and virtual batch normalization (normalize using statistics from a reference batch to reduce batch-to-batch variance). Each technique addresses a specific failure mode: feature matching reduces instability, minibatch discrimination combats mode collapse, label smoothing prevents discriminator saturation. The paper also introduced the Inception Score for quantifying sample quality, providing an automated metric (though imperfect) for evaluating GANs. This work established that successful GAN training requires multiple complementary tricks rather than just the basic algorithm, providing a toolkit that has become standard practice.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196">“Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation” (2018)</a></strong><br />
<em>Authors</em>: Tero Karras, Timo Aila, Samuli Laine, Jaakko Lehtinen (NVIDIA)<br />
This paper introduced progressive training: start with low-resolution images (4×4) and progressively add layers to generator and discriminator, increasing resolution (8×8, 16×16, …, up to 1024×1024). This approach stabilizes training (easier to learn low-resolution distributions first) and enables generating very high-resolution images that were previously impossible. The paper also introduced improved evaluation metrics and training techniques. The generated faces at 1024×1024 resolution were shockingly realistic, demonstrating GANs’ capability for high-fidelity generation. Progressive growing has influenced subsequent work (StyleGAN builds on it) and demonstrated that training curriculum—gradually increasing task difficulty—applies not just to data (easy examples first) but to architecture (simple generation first, complex later). The work showed that GAN training instability can be partially addressed through careful training procedures, not just architecture or loss modifications.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948">“A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks” (2019)</a></strong><br />
<em>Authors</em>: Tero Karras, Samuli Laine, Timo Aila (NVIDIA)<br />
StyleGAN redesigned the generator architecture to enable fine-grained control over generated images. Instead of feeding latent code directly into the generator, StyleGAN maps it through a mapping network to an intermediate latent space \(\mathcal{W}\), then uses this to control style at different resolution levels through adaptive instance normalization. This enables incredible control: changing coarse styles (pose, face shape) independently of fine styles (hair texture, skin pores). The paper demonstrated unprecedented image quality and introduced tools for analyzing and improving GANs (like perceptual path length metric). StyleGAN generated faces indistinguishable from real photographs, achieving a milestone in generative modeling. The architecture’s success showed that generator design matters enormously—not all ways of mapping noise to images are equally good. The disentanglement properties (ability to control attributes independently) made StyleGAN useful for semantic editing and style transfer, expanding GANs from pure generation to controllable synthesis.</p>

<h2 id="common-pitfalls-and-tricks">Common Pitfalls and Tricks</h2>

<p>Mode collapse is perhaps the most frustrating failure mode in GAN training. The generator discovers it can fool the discriminator by producing only a few types of outputs rather than the full data diversity. For MNIST, this might mean generating only 1s and 7s, ignoring other digits. For faces, generating only certain poses or expressions. Detection requires checking sample diversity, not just quality—generate many samples and verify they span the data distribution. Solutions include minibatch discrimination (let discriminator see multiple samples and detect homogeneity), unrolled optimization (let generator anticipate discriminator’s response), or using different loss functions like Wasserstein GAN that are less prone to mode collapse. Understanding that mode collapse stems from the generator finding local optima in the adversarial game helps recognize when it’s occurring and motivates these solutions.</p>

<p>Discriminator overpowering the generator early in training is common and destructive. If the discriminator becomes too good too quickly, it assigns probability near 0 to all generator outputs, providing vanishing gradients to the generator which can’t learn. This happens when the discriminator is too large relative to the generator, learning rate is too high for discriminator, or real/fake distributions are easily separable initially (generator starts terrible). Solutions: train discriminator less frequently (every \(k\) generator updates), use lower learning rate for discriminator, add noise to discriminator inputs (blurring the real/fake distinction), or use one-sided label smoothing (real labels = 0.9 instead of 1.0, reducing discriminator overconfidence). Monitoring \(D(\mathbf{x}_{\text{real}})\) and \(D(G(\mathbf{z}))\) helps: if real is always near 1 and fake always near 0, discriminator is too strong.</p>

<p>Using batch normalization in the discriminator can cause problems when batch sizes are small because batch statistics become unreliable. With batch size 1, batch norm fails entirely. Solutions include using larger batch sizes (at least 32-64), using layer normalization or instance normalization instead of batch norm, or using virtual batch normalization (normalize using statistics from a fixed reference batch). Understanding that discriminator’s normalization affects what features it learns helps debug training issues related to batch size.</p>

<p>Evaluating GAN quality is challenging because we can’t compute likelihood. Inception Score measures both quality (samples should be confidently classified) and diversity (should cover all classes) using a pre-trained classifier, but has limitations (doesn’t detect memorization, biased toward ImageNet classes). Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) compares statistics of real and generated samples in feature space, providing a better metric but still imperfect. For practical work, visual inspection remains important—generate many samples and manually check quality and diversity. Quantitative metrics complement but don’t replace human evaluation.</p>

<p>A powerful technique for stable training is spectral normalization, which constrains discriminator’s Lipschitz constant by normalizing weight matrices by their spectral norm (largest singular value). This prevents the discriminator from having arbitrarily large gradients, stabilizing training dynamics. The technique adds minimal computational cost (computing spectral norm via power iteration) while dramatically improving stability. Modern GANs often use spectral normalization in the discriminator as standard practice, showing how theoretical understanding of training dynamics (Lipschitz constraint improves stability) translates to practical techniques.</p>

<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>

<p>Generative Adversarial Networks learn to generate realistic data by training two networks adversarially: a generator creating fake samples from random noise and a discriminator distinguishing real from fake. The adversarial objective is formulated as a minimax game where the generator minimizes what the discriminator maximizes, creating competitive dynamics that drive both networks toward higher capability. At equilibrium, the generator’s distribution matches the data distribution and the discriminator cannot distinguish real from fake better than random guessing, though reaching this equilibrium in practice is challenging. Training alternates between discriminator updates (using real data and generator’s fakes) and generator updates (trying to fool the discriminator), requiring careful balancing to prevent either network from dominating. Mode collapse—the generator producing limited diversity—remains a persistent challenge addressed through architectural choices, modified objectives, and training techniques. GANs excel at generating high-quality, realistic samples (often superior to VAEs) and learning latent spaces with semantic structure enabling interpolation and manipulation. The implicit density modeling approach enables generating complex high-dimensional data without explicit probabilistic formulations, though at the cost of training instability and difficulty in evaluation. Understanding GANs deeply means appreciating both their creative power in generating realistic data and the delicate training dynamics that make them challenging but rewarding to work with in practice.</p>

<p>The GAN framework demonstrates that competition can be a powerful learning signal, a principle that has influenced deep learning far beyond generative modeling.</p>
