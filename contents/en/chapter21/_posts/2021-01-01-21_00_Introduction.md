Deep Reinforcement Learning combines deep neural networks with RL to handle high-dimensional state spaces. This chapter covers DQN (Deep Q-Network), policy gradient methods (REINFORCE, A3C), actor-critic methods (A2C, PPO), and applications like game playing (AlphaGo) and robotics. We explore how deep learning enables RL to solve complex real-world problems.
