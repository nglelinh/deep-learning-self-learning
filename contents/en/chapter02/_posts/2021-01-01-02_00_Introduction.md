Neural Networks are the foundation of modern deep learning. This chapter introduces the basic building blocks of neural networks, including neurons, layers, activation functions, and forward propagation. We'll explore how these simple units combine to create powerful learning systems capable of solving complex problems.

Understanding neural networks is essential for anyone working in deep learning, as they form the basis for more advanced architectures and techniques covered in later chapters.
