Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are probabilistic generative models that learn structured latent representations. By combining variational inference with neural networks, VAEs can generate new samples and interpolate smoothly in latent space. This chapter covers the VAE architecture, ELBO objective, reparameterization trick, and applications.
