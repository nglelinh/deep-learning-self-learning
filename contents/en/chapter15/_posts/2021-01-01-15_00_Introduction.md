Transfer learning leverages knowledge from pre-trained models to solve new tasks with limited data. Instead of training from scratch, we fine-tune existing models or use them as feature extractors. This chapter covers feature extraction, fine-tuning strategies, domain adaptation, and practical transfer learning with popular models like ResNet, BERT, and GPT.
