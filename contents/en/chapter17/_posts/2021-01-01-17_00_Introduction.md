This chapter applies deep learning to practical computer vision tasks: image classification, object detection (YOLO, Faster R-CNN), semantic segmentation (U-Net, DeepLab), instance segmentation (Mask R-CNN), pose estimation, and image generation. We cover architectures, datasets, metrics, and implementation details for real-world applications.
