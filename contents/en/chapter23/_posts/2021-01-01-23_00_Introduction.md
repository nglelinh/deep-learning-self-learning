Efficient deep learning makes models faster, smaller, and more deployable. This chapter covers model compression (pruning, quantization, knowledge distillation), efficient architectures (MobileNet, EfficientNet), hardware acceleration (GPUs, TPUs), mixed-precision training, and deployment strategies for edge devices and production systems.
