## Probability and Statistics for Deep Learning

Probability and statistics form a crucial foundation for understanding many deep-learning problems, especially in machine learning and data science. This section introduces the essential probabilistic concepts that frequently appear in convex deep-learning, from maximum likelihood estimation to Bayesian deep-learning.

### Why Probability Matters in Deep Learning

Many deep-learning problems arise from statistical modeling:

- **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: Finding parameters that maximize the likelihood of observed data
- **Bayesian Deep Learning**: Using probabilistic models to guide the search for optimal solutions
- **Stochastic Deep Learning**: Dealing with uncertainty and randomness in objective functions
- **Regularization**: Adding probabilistic priors to prevent overfitting
- **Risk Minimization**: Optimizing expected loss over probability distributions

### Key Topics Covered

1. **Basic Probability Theory**: Sample spaces, events, and probability axioms
2. **Common Probability Distributions**: Normal, exponential, and other distributions crucial for deep-learning
3. **Expectation and Variance**: Computing and optimizing expected values
4. **Bayes' Theorem**: Foundation for Bayesian deep-learning and inference
5. **Statistical Estimation**: Connecting probability theory to deep-learning problems

### Connection to Deep Learning

Understanding probability helps you:

- **Formulate Problems**: Convert real-world uncertainty into mathematical deep-learning problems
- **Choose Objective Functions**: Select appropriate loss functions based on probabilistic assumptions
- **Interpret Results**: Understand confidence intervals and statistical significance of solutions
- **Handle Noise**: Deal with measurement errors and stochastic processes
- **Design Algorithms**: Develop robust deep-learning methods that work under uncertainty

This foundation will be essential as we explore how probabilistic models lead to convex deep-learning problems in machine learning, statistics, and engineering applications.
