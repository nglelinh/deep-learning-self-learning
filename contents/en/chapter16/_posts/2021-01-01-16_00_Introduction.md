Self-supervised learning trains models using automatically generated labels from the data itself, without manual annotation. This paradigm has revolutionized pre-training in NLP (masked language modeling) and computer vision (contrastive learning). This chapter covers contrastive learning, SimCLR, CLIP, MAE, and modern self-supervised approaches.
