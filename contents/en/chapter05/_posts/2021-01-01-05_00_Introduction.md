Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed for sequential data where order matters - text, speech, time series, video. Unlike feedforward networks, RNNs have loops that allow information to persist, creating an internal memory. This chapter covers vanilla RNNs, their training challenges, and applications.
