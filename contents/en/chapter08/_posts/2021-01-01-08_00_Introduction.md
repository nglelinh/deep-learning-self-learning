Transformers revolutionized NLP and deep learning by replacing recurrent layers with self-attention. Introduced in "Attention Is All You Need" (2017), Transformers enable parallel processing, handle long-range dependencies better than RNNs, and have become the foundation of modern AI models like BERT, GPT, and beyond. This chapter covers the complete Transformer architecture and its variants.

**Key breakthroughs**: BERT, GPT-2/3/4, T5, Vision Transformers, and more - all based on this architecture!
