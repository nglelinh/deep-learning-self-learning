Understanding why deep learning models make certain predictions is crucial for trust, debugging, and compliance. This chapter covers visualization techniques (saliency maps, activation visualization), attention analysis, feature importance, LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, and adversarial examples. We explore methods to make black-box models more interpretable.
