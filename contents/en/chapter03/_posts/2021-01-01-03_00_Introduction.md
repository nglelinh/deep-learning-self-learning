Training neural networks is the process of finding the optimal weights and biases that minimize the difference between predictions and actual outputs. This chapter covers the fundamental algorithms and techniques used to train deep neural networks, including backpropagation, gradient descent, loss functions, and practical training strategies.

Understanding how neural networks learn from data is crucial for building effective deep learning systems.
