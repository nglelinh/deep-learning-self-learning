Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) pit two networks against each other: a generator creates fake data and a discriminator tries to distinguish real from fake. This adversarial training produces remarkably realistic images. This chapter covers GAN training, loss functions, common architectures (DCGAN, StyleGAN), training challenges, and applications.
