Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) extend deep learning to graph-structured data: social networks, molecules, knowledge graphs, and recommendation systems. This chapter covers graph representations, message passing, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), GraphSAGE, Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and applications in node classification, link prediction, and graph generation.
