Autoencoders learn efficient data representations through unsupervised learning. They compress input data into a lower-dimensional latent space and reconstruct it. This chapter covers vanilla autoencoders, denoising autoencoders, sparse autoencoders, and applications in dimensionality reduction, denoising, and anomaly detection.
