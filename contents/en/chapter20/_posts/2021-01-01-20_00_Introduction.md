Reinforcement Learning (RL) trains agents to make sequential decisions by maximizing cumulative rewards. This chapter introduces the RL framework: agents, environments, states, actions, rewards, and policies. We cover Markov Decision Processes, value functions, Q-learning, and policy gradient methods. These fundamentals prepare you for deep RL in the next chapter.
