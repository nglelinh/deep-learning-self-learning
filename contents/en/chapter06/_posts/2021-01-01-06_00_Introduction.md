Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) networks solve the vanishing gradient problem of vanilla RNNs by using gating mechanisms to control information flow. These architectures enable learning long-range dependencies in sequential data and are fundamental to modern NLP and sequence modeling.
