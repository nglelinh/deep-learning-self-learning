NLP applies deep learning to understand and generate human language. This chapter covers word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe), language models (GPT, BERT), sequence tasks (NER, POS tagging), text classification, machine translation, question answering, and text generation. We explore modern NLP architectures and their practical applications.
