This final chapter explores cutting-edge research and future directions in deep learning: multimodal models (CLIP, Flamingo), neural architecture search, meta-learning (learning to learn), continual learning, federated learning, neuromorphic computing, quantum machine learning, and emerging challenges like AI safety, fairness, and sustainability. We look at where deep learning is heading and open research problems.
